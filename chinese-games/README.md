========

The directory `dataset1` contains keyword blacklists from popular games with high download counts.
The directory `dataset2` contains keyword blacklists from games from popular Chinese game publishers and developers.  Each file's name in `dataset2` is prefaced by the publisher or developer that was used to discover the list (e.g., a file beginning with "tencent#" indicates that that list was discovered in a game found by downloading games published by Tencent).
