# Documenting censorship of the 19th National Communist Party Congress on WeChat 

## Key Findings 
From October 18 to October 24 2017, the Communist Party of China held its 19th National Communist Party Congress.

WeChat censored keywords related to the 19th National Communist Party Congress over a year prior to the event and updated blocked content as the event approached.

Surprisingly, we found that even neutral references to official party policies and ideology were blocked in addition to references to the Congress, party leaders, and power struggles within the Communist Party of China.
